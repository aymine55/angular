                <h4>Good as Gold Blog</h4>
                <p>A lot of the time when lists like this are put together, the emphasis is usually placed on small business
                    blogs that talk
                    about how to run and manage a business. And while such lists are certainly useful, I thought it would be
                    a good idea to
                    put together a list of blogs actually created and managed by retail store owners.</p>

                <h4>8 Beauty bloggers you should be following</h4>
                <p> On the weekend (or whenever—who are we kidding?), we love nothing more than checking out what our
                    favorite influencers
                    are posting, from the products they're raving about or the makeup tutorials they're loving. While makeup
                    and skincare
                    blogs launch all the time, we continue to go back to certain experts over and over again...</p>

                <h4>Good, Better, Best</h4>
                <p>Learning how to choose what kind of t-shirt to use for your craft or screen-printing project depends on
                    your crafting or
                    screen-printing business needs. Some fabric and screen-printing choices make more sense for your bottom
                    line than
                    others. Or perhaps you’re looking for a different kind of t-shirt for your business due to changing
                    needs.</p>

                <p>With the New Year a few months behind us now, hectic schedules and daily distractions have gotten in the
                    way of our most
                    well intended resolutions. If you are still looking to work on being healthier this year, eating
